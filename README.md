# We-Love-Movies-Project
This is a back-end centric project as a part of the Thinkful software engineering curriculum. A fictional company called "We love movies" needed the back-end portion of an app developed to connect to a pre-established frontend so that users could query what movies were playing at specific movie theaters and have returned some other data about each movie as well.

#Tools and techniques used
* JSX, Express and Knex.
* Database table creation and manipulation via Knex.
* Code orginzation via use of Router, Controller and Service files.
* Specific error handling per project requirements.
